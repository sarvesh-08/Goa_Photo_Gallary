# Demon Slayer Gallery â€” Static React (Vercel)

This is a static frontend React project (Vite + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion) that displays an animated image gallery and provides download buttons for images placed in `public/images/`.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit or include copyrighted Demon Slayer images unless you have the rights. Add your own images (or properly licensed images) named `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, etc. into `public/images/` before deploying.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Add images into `public/images/` (e.g. image1.jpg ... image6.jpg)
3. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build for production and deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
